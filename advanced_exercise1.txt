DevOps/AI Project on AWS: Deploy ML Model with SageMaker

Want to combine DevOps & AI in a real-world AWS project? Try this hands-on SageMaker workflow:

1. Define the Use Case
Predict customer churn, detect anomalies, or classify support tickets using historical data.

2. Prepare the Dataset
Clean and upload your dataset to an S3 bucket (CSV/JSON formats work great).

3. Build & Train ML Model
Use Amazon SageMaker Studio to select a built-in algorithm or bring your own (like XGBoost or sklearn).

4. Track Experiments
Use SageMaker Experiments to track training jobs, metrics, and parameters.

5. Deploy the Model
Host your model using SageMaker Endpoints for real-time inference.

6. Automate with GitHub Actions
Set up a CI/CD pipeline to retrain and redeploy the model automatically when new data lands in S3.

7. Integrate with AWS Lambda
Trigger inference via Lambda to automate decisions from external services (e.g., forms, apps).

8. Monitor the Model
Use SageMaker Model Monitor to detect data drift or performance degradation.

9. Secure It All
Use IAM roles for fine-grained access, encrypt S3 data, and apply VPC configurations.

This hands-on project simulates real world scenario where you would deploy ML model to AWS SageMaker.
